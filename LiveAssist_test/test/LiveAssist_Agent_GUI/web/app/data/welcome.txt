What's next:
- [Jacques] Add support for sending responses (outcomes) back to server
- [Jacques] Add support for retrieving pick-lists/intents from server
- [Pavlin] Add support for server-sent-events/websockets for communication from server to client (and perhaps vice-versa)
- Make idle screen be the same as busy screen but grayed out

Recent changes:

2014/02/18:
- Improved and reorganized MVC code structure, setting the stage for training and admin modes
- As a result, there is no longer a navbar on the sign-in page, just like the mock-ups
- On busy screen, fixed a bug where tab stop handling wasn't working properly in the data input section
- On idle screen, summary of last agent response now only shows variables that were confirmed by the agent

2014/02/11:
- Cleaned up picklist, intent, and variable handling to conform to the latest spec and doc
- The above includes support for lists of values, either specified as an array or as a URL to a file with one value per line
- The demo was updated to include to different city lists, one for departure city and one for arrival city, using both mechanisms
- On busy screen, when a textbox with a value if autofocused, the value is automatically highlighted for replacement
- On busy screen, added checkboxes for distinguishing between default values of certain fields and values changed or
  confirmed by agents.
- On busy screen, ensure that checkboxes are not tab stops so that tabbing still jumps between the variable input fields (this was not easy!)

2014/02/10:
- Added support for retrieving escalated interactions from the server. This happens when the "Make me busy" button is clicked.
  If no interaction is available, the original demo interaction data is used.

2014/02/03:
- On busy screen, added input classification section (with checkboxes). However, support needs to be improved/revamped to fix some issues when resizing the browser window

- On busy screen, switched audio file to a more suitable one (thanks Jacques!)

2014/01/30:
- Fixed bugs causing data (intents/interaction/audio) to only ever be loaded when run from local machine

2014/01/24:
- Added shortcut key handling infrastructure and support for the following shortcut keys (any of them can be changed):
____ When idle: Ctrl+` or Ctrl+~ to sign out (as with NCC)
____ When busy: Ctrl+Enter to indicate we are done with the message
____ When busy: Ctrl+<digit> to select an intent out of the list of intents. Moves down levels as intents are selected.
____ When busy: Ctrl+Backspace to back out of an intent selection (back up to the parent level)
- Added DONE button and caller-perceived latency progress bar in the bottom-right corner, just like in mock-ups
____ Currently the progress bar is set to reach its max after 30 seconds
____ Attempted to add it in the navigation bar but couldn't get it to look nice
- Added this welcome message
- Fixed some minor CSS alignment issues
